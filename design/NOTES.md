# Design notes (pixel-critical)

These rules are **non-negotiable**. If anything conflicts, the mockup wins.

## Pixel-critical (must match mockup)
- **Header/nav**: sticky, minimal. Active section = **thin red underline only** (no pills/blocks).
- **Hero**: full-bleed photo background + dark overlay; centered stack. Inline email input + red JOIN button.
- **Panels/cards**: subtle dark surfaces (`--bg-surface`) with very subtle border (`--border-subtle`). Avoid heavy separators.
- **Red usage**: accent only (buttons, underline, small labels). Never long red text.
- **Typography**: headings use **Space Grotesk**; restrained tracking; cinematic, not “techy”.
- **Spacing rhythm**: use 8/16/24/40/64/96; max width 1200; generous vertical rhythm.
- **Statement section**: text exactly:
  - “Built from fracture. Forged to endure.”
- **Gigs**: next show featured; past shows collapsible.

## Flexible (can vary slightly)
- Placeholder copy and data while content is incomplete
- Exact imagery for merch cards (until final images)

## Quality bar
Each milestone must include a visual compare against `design/mockup-v1.jpg` and a pass of the step completion checklist in `CODEX_WORKPACK.md`.
